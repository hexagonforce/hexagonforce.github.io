        <h3>STAR Voting</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.starvoting.org/">STAR Voting</a> is an
            alternative voting method that allows all citizens to vote their
            conscience and still get results that are closest to the aggregate
            vote of the citizens. It is an extension of
            <a href="https://www.rangevoting.org">Range Voting</a> that makes
            good compromises to answer common criticisms against Range Voting
            (such as the Unknown Lunatic nightmare).
